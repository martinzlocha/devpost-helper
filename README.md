# Devpost Helper

## What does it do?
Splits all submissions on Devpost based on the prize category, extracts a short description of each project and saves
it into multiple files. Also creates a separate file which can be easily loaded into Gavel.

## How should this be used?

```angular2html
python process_csv.py <path-to-devpost-export>
```
